what is html?:
HTML is the markup language used to create web pages. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. There are two types of html tags: block level and inline tags. A block level tag will always start on a new line and take up the full width available. Inline tags only take up as much width as necessary. An example of a block level tag is the `<div>` tag. An example of an inline tag is the `<span>` tag. A standard html page begins with a `<html>` tag and ends with a `</html>` tag. Within it there are usually two tags, `<head>` and `<body>`. The `<head>` tag of a html is not visible by the user and usually contains metadata of the web page, `<link>` tags which usually link to external cdns or stylesheets, `<script>` tags which contain the javascript of the page, `<title>` which contains the title metadata... Within the body is everything visible by the user, such as `<h1>` tags for headings, `<p>` tags for paragraphs, `<img>` tags for images and so on. Every html tag also contains attributes. Attributes are used to provide additional information about an element. Attributes always appear in the start tag and their values are placed in double quotes. An example of an attribute is the `src` attribute which is used to specify the source of an image. Some tags are special and have interactivity attached to them, such as `<button>` tags or `<a>` tags, which can have events attached to them that happen once the element has been interacted with. Without html it's hard to imagine how modern websites would look like and in modern days even some native apps use html abstraction to display their content.
